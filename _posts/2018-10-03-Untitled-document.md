  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I think even though I didn't completely understand the function and how to use it I didn’t give up and I persevered. I eventually understood it and started applying it.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>This is something that needs to be improved on as I didn’t do much of it in the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I did reflect on my work at the end of the lesson and this helped me as I took in what we had learnt in the lesson. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I could have been a bit more efficient during the lesson as I think I could have certainly got more work done during the lesson. I did get a bit distracted as well during the lesson. I could have also questioned a bit more in the lesson as this was something I didn't do much of.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

    <td>I will certainly try to be more efficient and time effective in the next lesson. THis will enable me to get more work done during the lesson. I will also try to use the questioning skill.</td>
